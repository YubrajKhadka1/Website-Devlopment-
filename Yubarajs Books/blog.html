        <h1>Affects Of Technology In Daily Life</h1>
        <p>
            Technology has been evolving from the dawn of the mankind. 
            As the humans gained more intelligence the technology also  
            became much more complex but the true motive of technology has 
            been to make the human life more easier, nothing impacts more in 
            our life than technology. the affect of technology is huge and will 
            grow more each day. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
                We are affected in various ways from the technology even the
                minute things. Our life has been way more easier than what it 
                used to be. It gaves us cars, bikes and other mode of transportation 
                that makes going from one place to another very easy. Phones, social medias 
                have connected the whole world. We can get any information from the internet. 
                calculators, computers have made solving problems a lot of more easier.
                Industries boomed, education got better and inclusive, buying things got more
                easier through e-commerce, ovearll it has created a lot of positive impacts but 
                everything has two sides and technology is not an exception it has some bad affects too 
                like risk of privacy, frauds, internet scams, warfare, loss of lives and properties 
                and so on. Technology can and will be a tool of destruction in the wrong hands 
                so it must be used wisely.
